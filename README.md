# Airbxb - An Airbnb Clone Fullstack App

This full-stack application is a clone of Airbnb built in 10 days as part of Coding Academy's Full-Stack Course we took. This application allows users to search and filter houses, view a detailed page of a chosen house, and reserve it for their preferred dates and guests count, and view their dashboard in which they can see their trips, orders, wishlist and see any houses they put for renting. Users can also add a house for other users to reserve.
